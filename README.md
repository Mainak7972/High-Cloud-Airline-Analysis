# High-Cloud-Airline-Analysis
In the High Cloud Airline project, I leveraged SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Excel for ETL processes to analyze flight operations and passenger preferences. I examined load factors, identified trends and peak travel periods, and developed KPIs such as monthly/yearly load factors, top carriers, and popular routes using interactive dashboards.
